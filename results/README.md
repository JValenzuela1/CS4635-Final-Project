# Results Folder

This directory contains the results generated by running the VTMOP optimization tool across different problem types. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific test problem and includes both raw output and analysis artifacts.

## Folder Structure

Each subfolder (e.g., `dir-convex`, `dir-nonconvex`) represents a problem instance (e.g., `f(c)`, `DTLZ2`) and follows a consistent structure:

- **`analyze_results.py`**  
  A Python script used to process raw output files and generate:
  - Summary tables for each objective count (`p = 2`, `3`, `4`)
  - Comparative graphs across all three budget levels (1000, 1500, 2000) for each metric

- **Graphical Outputs (`.png`)**  
  Each folder contains the following nine figures, organized by metric and objective count:
  - `avg_solutions_p{2,3,4}.png` – Total number of accepted solutions
  - `delaunay_p{2,3,4}.png` – Discrepancy values from the Delaunay triangulation
  - `rmse_p{2,3,4}.png` – Root-mean-square error of the surrogate model predictions

- **Summary Tables (`.txt`)**  
  Three text files list the numerical results for each `p` value:
  - `summary_table_p2.txt`
  - `summary_table_p3.txt`
  - `summary_table_p4.txt`

Each summary table contains rows for the 3 budgets (1000, 1500, 2000), displaying values for each metric (discrepancy, RMSE, total solutions).

## Usage

To regenerate all plots and summary tables, run the `analyze_results.py` script in each respective problem folder. This assumes that raw output files from VTMOP are already present in that directory.

## Problem Types

- **`f(c)`**: A convex test problem
- **`DTLZ2`**: A nonconvex benchmark problem from the DTLZ family

These problems help compare the behavior of VTMOP under different optimization landscapes.
